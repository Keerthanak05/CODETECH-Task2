Project: LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES

#### **Objectives**
1. Build a predictive model to estimate housing prices.
2. Analyze the impact of features like area, location, and amenities on pricing.
3. Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
4. Provide insights into key factors affecting housing prices.

#### **Key Activities**
1. Collect and preprocess housing data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categories).
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
3. Split data into training and testing sets.
4. Implement linear regression models (simple and multiple).
5. Evaluate the model using performance metrics.
6. Optimize the model with regularization (e.g., Ridge, Lasso).
7. Visualize results (e.g., scatter plots, residuals).

#### **Technology Used**
1. **Programming Language**: Python.
2. **Libraries**:
   - **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy.
   - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
   - **Modeling**: Scikit-learn, Statsmodels.
3. **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab.
